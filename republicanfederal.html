    <h4>Candidate's Statement</h4>
<p class="statement">
Four years ago, President Donald J. Trump ran on a promise to put America First, and he has kept that promise. President Trump fought the establishment to lower taxes for hardworking middle-class families, create better trade deals that stopped the offshoring of American jobs, and rebuild our military.</p>

<p class="statement">President Trump stands by his oath to defend and protect the American people. That’s why, as your President, Donald J. Trump has stood up to the radical left that would defund our police, allow our cities to devolve into lawless zones, and make our families less safe.</p>

<p class="statement">Lawless zones like CHOP, CHAZ, or whatever the radical left wants to call them cannot be allowed to happen again, and President Trump stands committed to stopping them. These aren’t peaceful gatherings of protestors. They are a hotbed of crime, promoting the wanton destruction of our homes, our businesses, and innocent lives. </p>

<p class="statement">His vision for America is based on equal opportunity for all. Treating everyone with dignity. A middle class where everyone - regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or disability - comes along.</p>

<p class="statement">That’s why President Trump stands proudly with our law enforcement who, day in and day out, put their lives on the line to keep our families and our children safe from dangerous criminals. Our men and women in blue deserve a President that has their back, who will work with them to make sure criminals are brought to justice, and not someone that would side with rioters that burn our buildings and destroy our communities.</p>

<p class="Statement">As your President, Donald J. Trump will continue to deliver on his promise to Make America Great Again, by holding China accountable for the virus they unleashed upon the world. We can and we will defeat the invisible enemy, so we can continue the economic prosperity that President Trump delivered when he was elected.</p>
<p class="statement">Vote to put America First and to Make America Great Again. Vote Donald J. Trump for President.</p>
